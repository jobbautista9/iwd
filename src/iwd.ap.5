.SH NAME
.sp
iwd.ap \- Access point provisioning files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
Description of access point provisioning files.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
An access point provisioning file defines the configuration of an IWD access
point. These files live in \fI$STATE_DIRECTORY\fP/ap (/var/lib/iwd/ap by default).
They are read when the \fInet.connman.iwd.AccessPoint.StartProfile(ssid)\fP DBus
method is used.
.SH FILE FORMAT
.sp
See \fIiwd.network\fP for details on the settings file syntax.
.SH SETTINGS
.sp
The settings are split into several categories.  Each category has a group
associated with it and is described in the corresponding table below.
.SS General Settings
.sp
The group \fB[General]\fP contains general AP configuration.

The group \fB[Security]\fP contains settings for Wi\-Fi security and authentication
configuration.
.TS

.SS IPv4 Network Configuration
.sp
The group \fB[IPv4]\fP contains settings for IWD\(aqs built\-in DHCP server.  All
settings are optional.  They\(aqre used if network configuration was enabled as
described in \fBiwd.config(5)\fP\&.  Omitting the \fB[IPv4]\fP group disables
network configuration for this access point so if an all\-defaults DHCP setup
is desired, the group header line must still be present:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
