iwd (1.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  This release stores the iwctl history file according to the XDG Base
  Directory Specification, under XDG_DATA_HOME (usually
  ~/.local/share/iwctl/history).
  The old file in ~/.iwctl_history is neither moved or cleaned up, so you are
  advised to do that yourself.
