Description: wireless daemon for Linux
 Minimalistic wireless daemon that uses modern Linux interfaces
 like cfg80211 and nl80211 (netlink).
 The daemon provides a D-Bus API.
 .
 The daemon can be controlled from the command line
 with the included iwctl client utility.
 .
 The included iwmon utility can be used
 to monitor the 802.11 subsystem generic netlink commands and events.
 It uses the nlmon kernel driver from Linux 3.10 and later.
 .
 Note that the package defaults
 to relying on dbus activation to start.
 If you want to use iwd standalone without any manager,
 then you'll need to manually enable the system service.
