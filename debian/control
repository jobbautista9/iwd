Description: wireless daemon for Linux
 Minimalistic wireless daemon that uses modern Linux interfaces like
 cfg80211 and nl80211 (netlink). The daemon provides a D-Bus API.
 .
 The daemon can be controlled from the command line with the included
 iwctl client utility.
 .
 The included iwmon utility can be used to monitor the 802.11 subsystem
 generic netlink commands and events. It uses the nlmon kernel driver
 from Linux 3.10 and later.
 .
 Note that the package defaults to relying on dbus activation to start.
 If you want to use iwd standalone without any manager, then you'll need
 to manually enable the system service.
